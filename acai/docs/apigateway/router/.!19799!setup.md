# Router Set Up

???+ example
    Don't like reading documentation? Then look at [our examples](https://github.com/syngenta/acai-ts-docs/blob/main/examples/apigateway) which can run locally!


### 1. Configure the Lambda

=== "Serverless Framework"

```yaml
functions:
    apigateway-handler:
        handler: api/handler/router.route
        events:
            - http:
                path: /
                method: ANY
            - http:
                path: /{proxy+}
                method: ANY
```

### 2. Configure the Router

There are three routing modes: `directory`, `pattern` and `list`; `directory` and `pattern` routing mode requires your project files to be placed in a particular way; `list` does not require any structure, as you define every route and it's corresponding file. Below are the three ways configure your router:

#### Routing Mode: Directory

???+ tip
    If you are using route params, you will need use dynamic file names which follow this pattern: `{some-variable-name}.ts`.

=== "file structure"

    ```
    ~~ Directory ~~                     ~~ Route ~~
